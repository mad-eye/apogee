# Welcome to MadEye!
#
# With MadEye you can code with your teammates in real-time.  Here are a couple
# things to get you started:
#
# 1. The file tree on the left is the project that was shared.  Clicking on a
# file will load the contents in this editor.  Edit away; press Cmd-Z or
# Ctrl-C to revert changes.
#
# 2. Other people who go to the same URL can edit the project with you.  You
# can see people's edits and selections as they type!
#
# 3. You can see where your collaborators are by the colored boxes in the
# file tree.  This is the same color as their cursor and selections.
# Their line will also be have the gutter highlighted the same color.
#
# 4. If you want to video-conference with your team, click on the hangout button
# on the top of the file tree to embed this page in a Google Hangout.  Your
# teammates can join the Hangout by pressing their button.
#
# 5. The editor has many powers!  Notice you can change the syntax mode
# (although we figure it out most of the time), color theme, tab size,
# soft vs hard tabs, vim/emacs keybindings, and more!  Press Cmd/Ctrl-F to
# find text in the editor, and press Cmd/Ctrl-F twice to find and replace.
# For more details, check out Ace's documentation at http://ace.ajax.org .
#
# 6. When you are ready, press the save button (the disk icon in the upper-left)
# to save the file to disk.  If you don't want your changes, press revert to
# replace the editor's contents to that of the file on disk.
