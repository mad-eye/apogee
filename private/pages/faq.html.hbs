  <dt>Can I install MadEye on OS X?</dt>
  <dd>Yes! Weâ€™ve tested MadEye thoroughly on OS X 10.6+.</dd>

  <dt>Can I install MadEye on Linux?</dt>
  <dd>We use it most frequently on Ubuntu, but it should work on any standard Linux distribution that NodeJS supports.
  </dd>

  <dt>Can I install MadEye on Windows?</dt>
  <dd>Maybe. It should work just fine on Windows 7+, but it
  hasn&apos;t been thoroughly tested and is not officially supported.
  You don&apos;t need to use `sudo` for `npm install`, of course.</dd>

  <dt>I closed the project accidentally, but I haven&apos;t saved the file yet!</dt>
  <dd>No worries, the unsaved contents of the file are stored behind the scenes.  Just refresh,
  and you should be fine.</dd>
