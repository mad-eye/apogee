  <dt>Can I install MadEye on Windows?</dt>
  <dd>Yes!  It should work just fine on Windows 7+, but it hasn&apos;t been as tested as thoroughly.  
  You don&apos;t need to use `sudo` for `npm install`, of course.</dd>

  <dt>Can I install MadEye on OS X?</dt>
  <dd>We’ve tested it thoroughly on 10.8.  It should work on any installation the latest version of NodeJS works on.</dd>

  <dt>Can I install MadEye on Linux?</dt>
  <dd>We use it frequently on Ubuntu, but it should work on any standard Linux distribution that NodeJS supports.
  Note that the default nodejs package on Ubuntu 12.04 is quite out of date (0.6.x); you should consider installing it
  with the <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">executable</a>, or
  via <a href="https://launchpad.net/~chris-lea/+archive/node.js/" target="_blank">Chris Lea&apos;s apt repo</a>.</dd>

  <dt>Can I install NodeJs using Homebrew?</dt>
  <dd>Yes!  You can install node via Homebrew, but sometimes Homebrew doesn&apos;t include the npm modules on its path.
  Make sure that you include <code>/usr/local/share/npm/bin</code> in your PATH.</dd>

  <dt>It says it installed MadEye, but when i type `madeye`, it says “command not found”.</dt>
  <dd>Check to make sure that <code>/usr/local/share/npm/bin</code> is in your PATH.</dd>

  <dt>The online project is acting a little funny, but I haven&apos;t saved the file yet!</dt>
  <dd>No worries, the unsaved contents of the file are stored behind the scenes.  Just refresh,
  and you should be fine.</dd>
